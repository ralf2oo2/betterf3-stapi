# BetterF3 StationAPI

BetterF3 StationAPI is a port of [BetterF3](https://github.com/cominixo/BetterF3) to b1.7.3 [StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI) based on the 1.16.2 version of the mod. It replaces Minecraft's original debug HUD with a highly customizable, more human-readable HUD.

The mod icon is a combination of the BetterF3 created by [Nirewen](https://github.com/nirewen) and the StationAPI logo.

## Features
Each line is part of a Module, you can:

- Change the colors of each module
- Change the position of each module
- Add and delete modules, as well as add spacings between them
- Disable individual lines of a module, or disable the whole module
- Add a shadow to the text rendered (Activated by default)
- Change the color of the background behind all lines
- Animations for opening/closing (with configurable speeds)

## Differences with the main mod
Currently there is no option to change the scale of the debug HUD, this might be added at a later date.

The modules available are:
- MinecraftModule
- FpsModule
- SystemModule
- TargetModule
- CoordsModule
- LocationModule
- EmptyModule

Others may be added later
